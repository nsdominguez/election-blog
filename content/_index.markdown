## A Forecast Model for the 2024 Presidential Election

Welcome to my forecasting blog for the 2024 Presidential Election! My name is Nick Dominguez and I am an A.B. Candidate in Government at Harvard University. I've created this model as part of the GOV 1347: Election Analytics course taught by Professor Ryan D. Enos. My model will be updated weekly, accompanied by a blog post explaining these changes and updates as the course progresses.
